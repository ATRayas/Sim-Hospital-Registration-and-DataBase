# Sim-Hospital-Registration-and-DataBase
Personal project with the purpose to mimic a realistic hospital patient archive (patient info: Names, addresses, Allergies, etc.)
Two main functions: Search for patient and insert new patient. Both functions utilize vectors to hold data, and search has an optional O(1) search with a hash map if user knows patientâ€™s ID number other-wise O(n).
